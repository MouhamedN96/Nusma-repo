## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Core Development Tools
- **Flutter SDK** (3.24.5 or later)
- **Dart** (3.5.4 or later)
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development, macOS only)
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended editor with Flutter extensions)

### AI Development Requirements
- **Python** (3.8 or later) for AI model integration and data processing
- **Node.js** (16.x or later) for backend AI services
- **Git** for version control
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized AI services)

### Virtual Environment Setup
This boilerplate supports multiple virtual environment configurations:

#### Python Virtual Environment (for AI scripts)
```bash
# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv ai_env

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source ai_env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
ai_env\Scripts\activate

# Install AI dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Flutter Environment Management
```bash
# Use Flutter Version Management (FVM) for consistent Flutter versions
dart pub global activate fvm
fvm install 3.24.5
fvm use 3.24.5
```

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flutter-mobile-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate Python virtual environment
   python -m venv ai_env
   source ai_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ai_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install Python AI dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Set up Flutter environment (optional but recommended)
   dart pub global activate fvm
   fvm use 3.24.5
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your actual API keys and credentials
   # IMPORTANT: Never commit .env files to version control!
   ```

4. **Install Flutter dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   # For development with hot reload
   flutter run
   
   # For specific platform
   flutter run -d ios
   flutter run -d android
   
   # For release build
   flutter run --release
   ```

## Key Dependencies

| Package | Purpose | Version |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `provider` | State management | ^6.1.2 |
| `go_router` | Declarative routing | ^14.2.7 |
| `shared_preferences` | Local storage | ^2.3.2 |
| `http` | HTTP client | ^1.2.2 |

## Development Guidelines

### State Management

This boilerplate uses the Provider pattern for state management:

```dart
class CounterProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;
  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

### Navigation

Routes are defined using go_router:

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (context, state) => const HomeScreen(),
    ),
  ],
);
```

### Theming

The app supports both light and dark themes:

```dart
ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
);
```

## Building for Production

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for app bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

## Customization

### Adding New Features

1. Create a new directory under `lib/features/`
2. Follow the established structure (models, providers, screens, widgets)
3. Register providers in `main.dart`
4. Add routes in `app/routes.dart`

### Styling

- Modify `core/themes/` for global theme changes
- Use consistent spacing and colors defined in constants
- Follow Material Design guidelines

## Performance Optimization

- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Implement lazy loading for large lists
- Optimize images and assets
- Profile your app regularly with Flutter DevTools
